# ACDC_Challenge

In this repository it is possible to find out way of dealing with the famous ACDC challenge. The focus is on the segmentation part but we have given a chance also to the classification.
In order to run the code it is necessary to download the dataset, which is publicly available at the following link: https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/#collection/637218c173e9f0047faa00fb/folder/637218e573e9f0047faa00fc
The code automatically unzip the file. However a folder named database has been created in google drive to store all the images and masks both for the training and the testing set.
Other indications will be provided in the jupyternotbook available uploaded in this github repository.
