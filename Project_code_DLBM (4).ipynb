Manual analysis of cardiac images is time-consuming and prone to errors, necessitating a precise and automated segmentation approach. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) and U-Net, have emerged as successful methods for medical image segmentation. U-Net, a 2D CNN architecture, shows respectable accuracy by incorporating skip links. This work aims to solve the segmentation and classification task proposed by the ACDC challenge, utilizing the ACDC dataset, which includes expert manual segmentations and various clinical diagnoses."

        "In the field of machine learning, one of the critical factors that significantly impacts model performance is the availability and quality of the training data. However, it is not uncommon to encounter scenarios where the training dataset is relatively small, limiting the model's ability to learn complex patterns and generalize well. To mitigate this challenge, researchers and practitioners often employ data augmentation techniques to artificially expand the training set, thereby enhancing its dimensionality. This essay explores the process of data augmentation, specifically focusing on creating additional images through rotation and flipping, and the organizational steps involved in preparing the augmented dataset in Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Augmentation for Image Classification:\n",
        "In image classification tasks, data augmentation serves as a powerful tool to increase the diversity of the training set by applying various transformations to the existing images. By introducing such transformations, the model becomes exposed to a wider range of scenarios, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Among the commonly used data augmentation techniques, rotation and flipping have proven to be effective in expanding the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rotation:\n",
        "The process of rotation involves rotating an image by a certain degree within a specified range. For instance, an original image can be rotated by 90, 180, or 270 degrees to create three additional variations. By randomly selecting rotation angles, we can generate multiple images with different orientations, increasing the training set's dimensionality. This augmented dataset will enable the model to learn and classify objects irrespective of their orientation, making it more adaptable to real-world scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flipping:\n",
        "Flipping is another widely employed data augmentation technique that horizontally or vertically mirrors an image. This transformation creates new instances by reversing the original image along the specified axis. By applying horizontal flips, we can generate images that exhibit a mirrored effect, contributing to increased variation in the training set. Similarly, vertical flips provide additional diversity by introducing an upside-down perspective. The augmented dataset resulting from these flips will help the model to be more resilient to changes in object orientation and achieve better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Organizational Steps in Google Drive:\n",
        "Before implementing the data augmentation process, it is essential to organize the augmented dataset in a structured manner. Google Drive provides a convenient platform for creating and storing the augmented images in separate folders. By creating distinct folders for rotated and flipped images, we can maintain a clear distinction between the original and augmented dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, a dedicated folder can be created in Google Drive to house the training dataset. Within this main folder, separate subfolders should be created for rotated and flipped images. These subfolders serve as the destination for the augmented images generated through the data augmentation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Namely, inside training folders \"images\", \"masks\", \"images2\", \"masks2\", \"images3\", \"masks3\" have to be created in advance to allow the code to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "By structuring the dataset in this manner, it becomes easier to keep track of the original and augmented images during the training process. Furthermore, it facilitates the integration of the augmented dataset with popular machine learning frameworks, as they often require the dataset to be organized into training, validation, and testing subsets."

        "This algorithm determines the Dice coefficients between each patient's fresh photos and their ground truth masks. This is accomplished by iterating through the patients in the new_images_label1, new_images_label2, and new_images_label3 lists, then iterating through the slices for each patient and calculating the Dice coefficient between the current slice and the corresponding ground truth mask using the dice_coefficient function. The dices1, dices2, and dices3 lists, respectively, provide the Dice coefficients. The Dice coefficient, which ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap), is a metric for comparing two sets. It is applied here to gauge how closely the fresh photos resemble the ground truth masks."

The function takes as input the training configuration parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, weight decay, momentum, training data loader, validation data loader, test data loader, optimizer and cost function.\n",

        "Within the function, an Early Stopping criterion is created, which is used to stop training when the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs. Next, the function iterates over the specified number of epochs and at each iteration calls the training_step function to train the network based on the training and validation data loader.\n",
